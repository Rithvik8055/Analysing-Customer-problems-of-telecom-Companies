It requires simulating a case of customer churn using  techniques such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes. Models are required to be build so as to predict whether a customer will cancel their techniques such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes. Models are required to be build so as to predict whether a customer will cancel their service in the future or not and then model comparison measures are made for taking interpretation and recommendations from the best model.
